## Project Overview

**Insight2Post** converts a short campaign brief into researched, platform-specific content automatically.
Give it one row in a Google Sheet and it will:

1. Search for source material using **Tavily**.
2. Aggregate raw content.
3. Produce a LinkedIn post, an X/Twitter post, and a short two-paragraph blog.
4. Persist the outputs back to the sheet for audit and publishing.

The repo README below is laid out so technical and non-technical stakeholders can quickly understand the flow, configuration, and outputs with embedded agent prompts directly within each step.

## Who benefits & Problems Solved ‚úÖ

**Who benefits**

* Marketing and content teams producing cross-platform posts.
* Agencies needing repeatable content pipelines.
* Growth/community teams that require fast, consistent output.

**Problems this solves**

* Manual research + multi-format drafting is slow and inconsistent.
* Hard to convert research into tailored posts that respect platform norms.
* No single source of truth ‚Äî this pipeline centralizes inputs and outputs.

---

## Key benefits ‚ú®

* **Speed:** Brief ‚Üí multi-platform content in minutes.
* **Consistency:** System prompts keep voice and structure consistent per platform.
* **Auditability:** All inputs/outputs recorded in Google Sheets.
* **Flexibility:** Swap models, adjust Tavily params, add platforms with minimal changes.

## Example input ‚Üí outputs (concise sample) üß™

**Sample sheet row**

* `Campaign`: `campaign-001`
* `Content Subject`: `How hybrid teams cut down hiring time`
* `Target Audience`: `Startup Founders & Talent Leads`

**Tavily request** (Step 5 payload)

```json
{
  "query": "How hybrid teams cut down hiring time",
  "search_depth": "basic",
  "include_answer": true,
  "topic": "news",
  "include_raw_content": true,

üî• Hiring faster without sacrificing quality

Startup founders ‚Äî hybrid teams can shorten time-to-hire while widening your talent pool. Here‚Äôs how:
1. Standardize interview scorecards for faster comparison.
2. Use async interview tasks to screen more candidates quickly.
3. Centralize hiring notes in one place for quick decisions.

Try these in your next hiring sprint and share what worked.  
#Hiring #Startup #TalentAcquisition #RemoteWork
```

**Sample Tweet**

```
Hybrid teams + async interviews = faster hires. Try standard scorecards + async tasks to speed screening. What‚Äôs your fastest hiring hack? üöÄ #Hiring #Startups
```

**Sample Blog (2 paragraphs)**

```
Hybrid work models are helping startups reduce hiring timelines by combining remote reach with structured local processes. Standardized interview scorecards and asynchronous screening tasks allow teams to evaluate more candidates efficiently while keeping quality high.

To implement this, centralize candidate notes, automate scheduling for local interviews, and use short async tasks for initial screening. These steps reduce bottlenecks and help teams make faster, more confident hiring decisions.
